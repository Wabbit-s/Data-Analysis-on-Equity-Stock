# Analyzing Stock Performance & Building a Dashboard using Python & Watson Studio

# Stock Performance Analysis & Dashboard

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing stock performance through a comprehensive data analysis and visualization approach using Python and IBM Watson Studio. The goal is to gain practical experience in financial data analysis and create an interactive dashboard to monitor and evaluate stock metrics.

## Features

- Real-time Stock Data Collection: Utilizing web scraping techniques with Beautiful Soup, the project extracts real-time stock data from various financial websites, ensuring up-to-date information for analysis.

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: The extracted data is processed using Pandas and NumPy libraries, ensuring data accuracy and consistency by handling missing values and outliers.

- Financial Metric Calculation: The project implements statistical calculations and financial metrics, such as daily returns, moving averages, and volatility analysis, to evaluate stock performance.

- Interactive Dashboard: Leveraging IBM Watson Studio, an interactive dashboard is built to visualize the stock performance metrics. The dashboard provides insights and trends, making it easier to interpret the data.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and manipulation.

- IBM Watson Studio: The platform employed for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.

- Beautiful Soup: The web scraping library to extract real-time stock data from financial websites.

- Pandas & NumPy: Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and manipulation.
